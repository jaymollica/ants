ants
====

This is my attempt to create a neat info graphic using ant data.  The data was taken from the ant web repository: https://github.com/calacademy/antcat, put into mysql then regurgitated into JSON.  I'm using d3js and the sunburst example.

Still a lot of small things that are not working and I hope to fix those and add features over time.  I hope you like it.
